# Terraform configuration examples for gridscale.

This repository contains some configuration files you can use as an example to get started with gridscale and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). We have step-by-step guides on how to use these config files in our [tutorials](https://gridscale.io/en/community/tutorials/terraform-ubuntu-einrichten-gridscale/).

To use the config files, you'll need an [API token](https://my.gridscale.io/Easy/APIs/) and a [gridscale](https://my.gridscale.io/signup/) account.

After Terraform is up and running, you can navigate to one of the example directories `cd ./single-server/server-only/` and run `terraform init` and then `terraform apply` at this point you will be prompted to enter your API credentials mentioned above.

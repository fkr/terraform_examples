# Terraform configuration examples for gridscale.

This repository contains some configuratoin files you can use as an example to get started with gridscale and Terraform. we have step-by-step guides on how to use these config files in our [community](https://gridscale.io/en/community/tutorials/) section.

To use the config files, you'll need [API tokens](https://my.gridscale.io/Easy/APIs/) and a [gridscale](https://my.gridscale.io/signup/) account.

To get Terraform up and running you can navigate to one of the example directories `cd ./single-server/server-only/` and run `terraform init` and then `terraform apply` at this point you will be prompted to enter your API credentials mentioned above.
